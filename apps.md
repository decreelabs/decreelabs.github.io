## Project roles for Jira

Project role tab panel provides a project tab panel and an issue tab panel to view the users in different roles associated with a project.

It is particularly useful when a workflow condition requires an approval from a user belonging to a particular role. The user can quickly view all the users in a particular project role and contact them for approval if required.
